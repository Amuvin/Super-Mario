# Super-Mario
"The Super Mario",as you are going to play, is the remake version of  "Mario Forever" (first released in 2003 (Michael Gdaniec's item)). The major purpose of this project is to restore the characteristics of the original game. The remake version of Mario Forever contains only one world. Because of the poor playability, it is just for study and learn.
